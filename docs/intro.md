# Moka Macro

`Moka` is a single macro that generates a `Fields` object which allows to access
the name of the case class parameters. Works for scala 2.13. Support for scala 3 is planned.

## Installation
To install, add this line into `build.sbt`
```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.vimalaguti" %% "moka" % "@VERSION@"
```
